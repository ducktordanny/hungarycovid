## To do:

* [x] Finish route containers
* [x] Server side refreshes
* [x] API refresh after 30 mins of cachedTime
* [x] Client side: API data treatment fixes... (Bring data from root (App.js) to leafs (Home, Covid, PoliceActions))
* [ ] React Google Charts memory leak.
* [ ] Map's link not available after a day. Somehow I should save it.
* [ ] Check for any bug or issue before publish. Optimization.
* [ ] Git publish

## Issue:
